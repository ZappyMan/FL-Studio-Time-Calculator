# FL-Studio-Time-Calculator
FL Studio keeps track of how many active hours you spend on each project, but not your total time in the program. With this application, you can finally see your total hours without having to open up all your files and adding everything together! Idle time is still not accounted for, so the time this program displays to you only shows your active working hours. You may also select dates for the program to search between, say, if you wanted to see how many hours you spent on FL in a given month (or whatever time frame you like)!

This program was created out of the primal, human urge to keep track of and gawk at the amount of time we all spend on FL Studio. For better or for worse, we will never stop producing!

This program does not modify your save files in any way, its only allowed to read file contents.
